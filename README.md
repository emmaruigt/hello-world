# hello-world

This is a little thing about me: I'm 31 years old, I like kickboxing, I'm really into healthy food and cooking. I try to take in as little sugar as possible. I do smoke though, so not totally healthy. I'm trying to start with running, but I'm mostly walking for now :D I love my collegues and my job, even though its a lot of sitting behind a computer. Well. That's it for now! See you :) Greetings Emma
